# Donation

Software development is a continuing process. It is kindly hoped to receive continuing development / maintainance allowance.  
Currently, Easer is maintained by myself in my spare time. It's unfortunate that I couldn't make any promise about the time spent in maintaining Easer (though I really like it and put a lot of effort into it).

If you like Easer or would like to see it growing well, please consider donation -- that I could, maybe, buy a better pack of food so that I won't easily get a stomachache LOL. Any amout is welcome, and I kindly appreciate your support.

You can donate to Easer through one of the following methods:

* Liberapay <a href="https://liberapay.com/Easer/donate"><img alt="Donate using Liberapay" src="https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg"></a>
* BountySource [BountySource](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/easer).
* OpenCollective [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/Easer)

If you believe Easer lacks some functionality you needs and would like to pay for its development, you could consider creating a (Bounty) Issue.

Alternative, you can also [donate to me](https://me.ryey.icu/donate/).

If you believe other methods of donation may be useful or better, please contact me:
